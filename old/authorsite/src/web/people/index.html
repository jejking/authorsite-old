            Authorsite.org was created by John King in September 2002 to faciliate the creation of websites
            focussed on the life and works of writers, such as the one I have maintained on the German writer
            <a href="http://www.juenger.org/index.php" target="_blank">Ernst JÃ¼nger</a> since 1996, but with far greater
            ease of maintenance and breadth of functionality.

            When my former employer, mondus, underwent a "radical restructuring" in early 2002, I decided to consolidate
            and expand my Java knowledge and to take the opportunity to produce a bibliographic application that would
            meet the requirements I felt had been neglected by purveyors of commercial bibliographic managment programs.
            This application is the result - it's a good start and I've learnt far more from getting stuck in to coding
            and deployment than I ever could have from books and courses. A lot more needs to be done, but I'm happy to have
            got this far.

            Any employers looking for people with Java/XML skills in the London, UK or EU areas are warmly invited to
            look at my <a href="people/cv1.html">C.V.</a>.
