        <h1>conceptual analysis</h1>
        <p>
            Authorsite.org's bibliographic application represents a significant step forward in the field of 
            bibliographic database management software. This has been achieved by rethinking the fundamental
            tasks such software is asked to deliver and the models used in their delivery.
        </p>
        <h2>tasks</h2>
        <p>
            Typically, bibliographic database software is used to manage a list of records of predefined atomic types (books,
            journal articles, theses, conference proceedings, etc), which can then be queried and the results formatted according
            to various style prescriptons. They also facilitate the attachment of annotations to individual records and may provide
            some form of categorisation of records by "keyword".
        </p>
        <p>
           In one respect, our software is quite similar - it manages a number of records of predefined atomic types. However,
           if differs fundamentally in the way that the records are linked together - it actually links them together to form a network 
           of inter-related items and producers rather than leaving them as a list of unrelated items. This facility to create a network of 
           relationships is what makes the software a critical step forward for academic and other users as well as enrichening the
           web experience. Users can thus interrelate items - subject to predefined but highly customisable business rules - to record
           both hard (A is an edition of B, C is a film of D, E is a translation of F) and soft (G was inspired by H, I is a criticism of J)
           statements which are of substantial use value in documenting and understanding a particular area of investigation.
        </p>
        <h2>model</h2>
        <h3>media items and media producers</h3>
        <p>
            At the lowest level, the conceptual model identifies discrete media items and media producers, which can either be people
            or organisations (such as companies, NGOs, governments, universities, etc). Media items are modelled in two parts: core data
            which is common to all items regardless of type (title, year of production, type, comments) and type specific detail. The
            software recognises that there can be a series of composition relationships between media items. For example, a chapter in a 
            book of critical essays is seen to be in a "containment" relationship with the book it is published in, or a journal article can
            be seen to be contained in a volume or issue which would in turn be "contained" in a record for that journal. Finally,
            media items are associated with one or more languages - an essential improvement on much software in this area.
        </p>
        <h3>production relationships</h3>
        <p>
            Media producers (people and organisations) are related to media items through the notion of "production relationships".
            Each media item has a number of obligatory and possible production relationships (e.g. a book must have a publisher, but may
            or may not have a translator or illustrator) with which an arbitrary number of people or organisations can then be associated, thus
            dispensing with artificial constraints such as "Author 1", "Author 2", etc. A media producer may also be associated with more than
            one production relationship for a given media item. For example, an individual may be both the author and publisher of a book.
         </p>
         <h3>intra media relationships</h3>
         <p>
            The network of relationships between media items is implemented through the concept of "intra media relationships" which
            carry the information about translation, edition, criticism and other relationships between discrete media item records.
         </p>
         <h3>rules</h3>
         <p>
            With the extra expressive power given by production and intra media relationships, strict rules are required in order to maintain
            the logical integrity of the bibliography. These allow the application to provide high-level sanity checks on the data being
            entered, to prevent for instance the declaration of a person as the film director of a journal article or the same article being
            declared as the film version of a book. The rules declare "obligatory" relationships which must be in place before an item can
            be published as well as "expected" and "permitted" relationships which are not absolutely necessary but which may be required to
            describe an item and its context fully. Furthermore, the rules define "obligatory" attributes - the minimum data set required to
            describe the item as a discrete entity.
         </p>
         <p>
            The definition of the rules is therefore a key aspect in preparing a deployment of the bibliographic application.
         </p>
         <p>
            The syntax for defining the rules will shortly be reviewed to enable more powerful and flexible means of describing the
            rules. A new approach will bring this syntax into line with established current approaches to ontologies.
