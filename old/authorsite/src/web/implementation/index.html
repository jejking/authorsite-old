        <h3>analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The bibliographic application is sophisticated both in its concept and
            in its implementation in code. It is posited on the notion that a 
            bibliography is not simply a list, but rather a network of
            interrelated meta-data, as explained in our <a
            href="implementation/concept/index.html" title="explore the concepts">
            Conceptual Analysis</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>design</h3>
        <p>
            In order to facilitate an open, scalable
            and flexible platform, the application has been implemented as a 
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/" target="_blank">J2EE</a> Java application, as the <a
            href="implementation/architecture/index.html" title="understand the architecture">Architecture
            and Design</a> analysis explains. The document also discusses the design patterns used.
        </p>
        <h3>code</h3>
        <p>
            For developers, <a href="implementation/javadoc/index.html" 
            title="browse the javadoc">javadoc</a> is available, as is <a href="implementation/xref/index.html" 
            title="browse the java source code">java source cross reference</a>. SQL, XSLT and ant build
            scripts are available with the source <a href="download/index.html">release</a>.
         </p>
         <h3>deployment</h3>
         <p>
            Finally, we give detailed instructions on how the web application might be <a href="implementation/deployment/index.html"
            title="how to configure and deploy the application">deployed</a>, using the deployed demonstration
            application as an example.
