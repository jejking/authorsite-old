        <h1>building and installing the application</h1>
        <p>
            This is a brief guide to building, installing and configuring the application.
        </p>
        <h2>Required Software</h2>
        <p>
            The following software is required to run the software as it currently stands:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">JDK 1.4.1`</a>. A 1.4 JDK is required because I am
            using its Regular Expression library at the moment.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.jboss.org/" target="_blank">JBoss</a>. I am currently running the 
            JBoss_3.0.6_Tomcat_4.1.18 release with embedded Tomcat.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>. The software currently runs
            with the 7.2 version. Changes in the 7.3 release mean that some of the SQL scripts complain and I
            haven't updated them yet.</li>
            <li><a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL JDBC Driver</a>. pg73jdbc.jar seems to work fine.</li>
            <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/" target="_blank">Ant</a>. The build scripts require the 1.5
            release.</li>
            <li><a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">XDoclet</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_blank">JDOM</a>. Beta 8 is the latest release.</li>
            <li><a href="http://jaxen.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Jaxen</a>. Jaxen is an open-source XPath implementation in Java</li>
            <li><a href="http://saxpath.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Saxpath</a>. Is needed by Jaxen.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.junit.org/" target="_blank">JUnit</a>. Required to run the test suites.</li>
            <li><a href="http://http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy" target="_blank">JTidy</a>. Java port of W3C's Tidy application. Needed to tidy up
            Javadoc and manipulate its output.</li>
            <li><a href="http://javasrc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Javasrc</a>. Produces java source cross reference and without
            all the hassle of trying to knock Maven's JXR into shape.</li>
            <li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Webserver</a>. The demonstration application is running
            a tuned version of Apache 2.0.44.</li>
            <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-connectors/jk2/doc/" target="_blank">mod_jk2</a>. If you are
            running an Apache front end to the bibliographic application, you'll need this to pass requests through to Tomcat and JBoss.
            Configuring this is a black art, however.</li>
            <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=74211" target="_blank">the application source code</a>. Download the source
            from the Sourceforge CVS servers.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Configure the environment</h2>
        <p>
            Full details of how to do this will follow. However, given the alpha nature of the software, I only expect
            people with a significant level of IT knowledge to be experimenting it and so only give guidelines here.
        </p>
        <h3>Database server</h3>
        <p>
            The application should connect to the database server as the user "application". The sql scripts also expect the presence
            of users "dbreader" and "dbwriter". These users should be created independently of the sql scripts (preferably without privileges
            to create users or databases) and given suitably secure passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some database tuning may be required, including the setting of OS kernel shared memory parameters. I currently run PostgreSQL
            with Linux's shmall and shmmax set to 128M, postgres' shared buffers set to 15200 and sort memory at 32168. This is probably 
            overkill and more precise tuning advice will only emerge following sustained and systematic load testing.
        </p>
        <h3>Application Server</h3>
        <p>
            JBoss is a powerful and flexible application server. The default server set up starts more services than are strictly necessary
            for the application to run and which could be dispensed with to free resources and minimise any unnecessary security risks. You
            will need to pay particular attention to configuring <code>postgres-service.xml</code>, <code>tomcat41-service.xml</code> in the
            deploy directory, <code>jboss-service.xml</code> and <code>login-config.xml</code> in the conf directory. I will shortly supply
            details of my configuration. The PostgreSQL JDBC driver should be placed in the lib directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are going to use Apache to front the web application and leverage its many modules, including caching and compression,
            you will need to configure this as well. The current build scripts produce a tar.bz2 file with static content (html and images)
            to be deployed to apache in a directory /bibWebApp under DocumentRoot. As well as the Apache binaries, you will also need to 
            compile mod_jk2 and deploy that into Apache's modules directory and configure workers2.properties to handle Struts actions.
            Example configuration files to follow.
        </p>
        <h3>Build Environment</h3>
        <p>
            You will need to edit <code>build.properties</code> and <code>build.database.properties</code> to suit your personal environment.
            JDOM, Jaxen and Saxpath should also be placed somewhere on the classpath so that the EJBs will compile. Ant must on your
            path.
        </p>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
            The first task is to create the database tables. Run <code>ant createDatabase</code>. You can then run 
            <code>ant productionBuild -Dbase="http://pathToYourServer/bibWebApp/"</code>. This produces two files
            in the build/final directory - <code>content.tar.bz2</code> and <code>bibWebApp.ear</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Deploy</h2>
        <p>
            Static content is deployed to the bibWebApp directory under Apache's configured DocumentRoot. Copy 
            <code>content.tar.bz2</code> to that directory and unpack it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The J2EE application is the EAR file. Copy this to JBoss's server/default/deploy directory and either
            start up JBoss or let it hot deploy.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's it. The application is now usable from http://pathToYourServer/bibWebApp/home/index.html.
        </p>
        <p>
            These guidelines are rough and rudimentary in nature, but should help get you started. The software and the documentation
            are very much works in progress and I would very much appreciate feedbacks, comments, suggestions and positive criticism.
            Detailed configuration and set up instructions will follow. Some aspects of the deployment <em>are</em> difficult because
            they are so badly documented - mod_jk2, JBoss' JAAS and JDBC authentication are prime examples. I will also be bringing
            together various aspects of Linux configuration and security which impact on a deployment of the application.
