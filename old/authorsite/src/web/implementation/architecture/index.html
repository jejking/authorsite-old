        <h1>architecture and design</h1>
        <h2>a multi-tier J2EE architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The application is implemented as multi-tiered J2EE application utilising core J2EE technologies.
            Entity EJBs leveraging Container Managed Persistence and Container Managed Relationships provide the 
            persistence layer, communicating with a relational database (currently PostgreSQL). Session EJBs provide
            business logic and services, supported by plain java objects, as well as the external application of the API
            which exposes business methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst the architecture facilitates the development and deployment of multiple client platforms, the first to be
            developed is a Java web application using servlets and JSPs, leveraging the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/"
            target="_blank" title="jakarta struts website">Jakarta Struts</a> framework, which provides a powerful MVC
            architecture. Custom tags are used to minimise java code in the JSPs whilst filters and servlet event listeners provide
            powerful runtime functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application draws heavily on J2EE patterns and the good practice these are said to embody. Examples include: 
            Session Facade, DTO Factory, Data Transfer Object, Sequence Block Primary Key Generation, Data Transfer Hashmap (for
            details DTOs) and MVC/Front Controller (utilising Struts).
        </p>
        <p>
            A variety of factors influenced the choice of architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java was chosen as the main implementation language because it offered a degree of familiarity (from previous employment), a
            a powerful and flexibility core API with many more libraries available, and platform indepedence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that a key requirement was web-enablement, at least some of the J2EE platform would need to be used. Although there are sa 
            great many alternatives to Sun's servlet/JSP combination, this is the one with the greatest familiarity to developers, and 
            this was the reason it was chosen. Whilst there is no critical reason to use EJBs to implement business logic and persistence,
            the availability of open source container implementations in the form of JBoss and JoNAS (we currently use the former) together
            with the huge time savings afforded by the provision of transactions, security, connection and instance pooling, etc, meant
            that their use was highly advantageous. Similar concerns over ease of implementation motivated the use of the Jakarta Struts
            framework and its valuable support code.
        </p>
        <h2>ontology and code generation</h2>
        <p>
            A key feature of the bibliographic application is its flexibility regarding the types of media items and their attributes 
            and the interrelationships amongst them. These are documented in an xml file - <code>bibTypesRelationships.xml</code>, which
            is in turn constrained by a W3C xml schema file, <code>bibTypesRelationships.xsd</code>. This provides the facility for 
            defining a basic bibliography ontology, albeit with some limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ontology file is used by the business logic components to enforce the logical integrity of the database at application
            level because the complexity is such that it could not be handled by standard relational database constraints. The current
            approach uses XPath via the open-source Jaxen library. Struts action methods also use the rules engine API to load
            type-appropriate choices into the session context for media items which are currently being edited.  
        </p>
        <p>
            However, perhaps the most interesting use of the ontology file is in code generation. Because it is in xml, xslt is used
            to generate java source code representing entity EJBs, DTOs, DTO Assembler objects and JSPs, whilst we currently use a
            custom SAX based class to generate the corresponding SQL DDL statements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further code generation is faciliated by the use of <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">xdoclet</a>
            to maintain ejb and jboss deployment descriptors. XSLT is further used to generate the final JSPs and HTML pages for use
            in the web application, thus ensuring a high degree of homogeneity and providing one point to amend the site look and feel.
            All code generation, as with other build related activities, are controlled by <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/"
            target ="_blank">Jakarta Ant</a> scripts.
