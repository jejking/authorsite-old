# could use this for dictionary definition like rels
# e.g. "fermented drink made from barley and flavoured typically with hops" would have an "IS_DEFINITION_OF" relationship to "beer"
IS_DEFINITION_OF=definition
# "beer" would have an "HAS_DEFINITION" relationship to "fermented drink...."
HAS_DEFINITION=has definition

# words that sound the same in standard pronounciation
# e.g."fair" and "fare" in English
HOMONYM=homonym

# we don't need to note HOMOGRAPHS, that's the same text, same locale, different type

# use synonym for vocab nodes which mean same sort of thing in same language
SYNONYM=synonym
# use translation for vocab nodes which mean same sort of thing in different languages
TRANSLATION=translation

# use for opposite in same and different languages. (not likely to be using it to record opposites in multiple languages, tho')
OPPOSITE=opposite

# could be used for marking say "House of Lords" -> Bundesrat. Not quite, but they're both upper chambers of parliament
CULTURAL_EQUIVALENT=cultural equivalent

# say we have two nodes, "dog" and "it's a dog's life". The latter would have an "EXAMPLE_OF" relationship to dog
EXAMPLE_OF=example of
# staying with the dog's life example. "dog" would have an "HAS_EXAMPLE" relationship to "it's a dog's life".
HAS_EXAMPLE=has example

# for when two vocab nodes are the same concept but spelt differently. Either due to our Atlantic cousins, or because it just isn't fixed
ALTERNATIVE_SPELLING=alternative spelling

# either for very basic etymology or for morphological linking, e.g, blind->blindly. Blindly "IS_DERIVED_FROM blind
IS_DERIVED_FROM=is derived from
# blind "HAS_DERIVATION" blindly
HAS_DERIVATION=has derivation
